 * Date: April 9, 2020
 * Purpose: To read the file and add the words into a hashmap and setting their values to 0. Then read another file 
 *  with characters and values into a hashmap that will be used later to calculate the value of the each word from the first file
 * Inputs: No user input
 * Output: Will print onto the console each word from the words.txt and then their value next to them as well as the time it took for each part of this program
 * to run.
